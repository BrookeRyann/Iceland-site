            Swimming in the ocean off the coast of reykjavik in the middle of winter. <br>
            geothermal heat is not only used to heat up swimming pools and or hot tubs.<br>
            its also used to warm up a small bay on reykjavik's south coast, raising the <br>
            temperature of the ocean just enough to make it comfortable to swim in durring the summer. <br>
            I think that it is very cool that people in iceland are about to swim all year long <br>

            In Iceland they say that they lives depended on being able to swim because in the <br>
            pool Icelanders say that "when we are in the pool eveyone is equal" they also like it <br>
            because there is no phones when you are swimming because you have to leave them in your <br>
            locker making it so you have to socialize and talk to people and not be distracted on your phone. <br>
            Icelanders also like it because it is a national pastime because icelanders instead of going to the <br>
            park or the pub they like to go to the pool that way they can get fresh air and exercise and <br>
            discuss world matters in the hot tub.
